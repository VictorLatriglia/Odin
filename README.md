# Odin
At the moment this is just a base code for a VPS system that could be able to control traffic on cities and maybe even beyond; i'll be updating this readme as the code begins to take shape. Shout out to Adrian Rosebrock from pyimagesearch.com for his amazing code and opimization with the CV part of Odin (Provisional name BTW) and his way of teaching it in a way that even a python newbie such as your server could read and understand the code easyly. There's a show at my university on Octover so a prototype should be ready by then, so keep an eye out for any updates if you're interesed.

Oh and by VPS i meant Visual Positionament System, not Virtual Private Server... Just for the record
